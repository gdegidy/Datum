<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg 3 is my second clone. The first clone worked but the antenna is ocassionally visible on the back of his head. The new clone design is aimed at reducing the visibility of the antenna. I was going to look for a plastic fetus to use but I had an offbrand fingerling so I suspended it in a glass jar using string and filled the jar with canola oil. I also added ball bearings in the head in an attempt to weigh it down in the oil. I designed the base in solidworks to hold a circular pcb of 93 neopixels and the ESP8266 underneath a piece of glass which the jar sits on. There's a hole in the front of the design, and the correct hole drilled underneath it for the rotary encoder which controls power and speed of the cycling colors. </p>
