# Pill Bottle Lights

This uses a strip of 50 individual neopixels wired together that I found on aliexpress. When they arrived, I didn't know what to do with them but
I remembered a tiktok that my friend sent to me where there were a bunch of lit up pill bottles hanging from the walls like christmas lights, so I just stole
the idea and made that. I took off the pill labels and drilled a hole in the center of each lid for the light to slide into. I have my typical setup of 5 volts going into the pixels
and 5v-3v regulator to power the esp which sends out data to the pixels.
